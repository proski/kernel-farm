kernel-farm
===========

kernel-farm is a collection of tools to set up multiple Linux kernel
source trees and test external drivers against them.

The workflow goes like this:

- Edit .farmrc for kernels to test and other parameters.

- Run farm-checkout to check out the source trees.

- Optionally run farm-hardlink to reclaim some disk space.  It can take
hours to run.

- farm-config32 or/and farm-config64 to create configured build trees.
Those should take much less disk space than the sources, as the kernels
are not compiled, except a few files needed to support module build.

- Change to the source of the module to test.  Run farm-compile.

- Examine Log* manually and with farm-warnings.
