kernel-farm
===========

kernel-farm is a collection of tools to set up multiple Linux kernel
source trees and test external drivers against them.

Installation
------------

If using a checked out version, run "autoreconf -i".

Run "./configure; make install" (see INSTALL file for details).

If using a packaged version, install the package.

Review the contents of farm.conf. If you need to change anything, create
a file named .farmrc in your home directory and change the parameters as
needed.

Workflow
--------

- Run farm-checkout to check out the source trees.

- Optionally run farm-hardlink to reclaim some disk space (on the scale
of several gigabytes). It can take several hours run.

- Run farm-config32 or/and farm-config64 to create configured build
trees. Those should take much less disk space than the sources, as the
kernels are not compiled, except a few files needed to support module
build.

- Change directory to the source of the module to test. Run farm-compile.
The testing progress will be shown.

- Examine Log* files manually and with farm-warnings.

kernel-farm specifically recognizes MadWifi and ndiswrapper sources and
suppresses building userspace utilities, as it's pointless to compile
them multiple times.
